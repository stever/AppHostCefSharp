# AppHostCefSharp

## About

CefSharp doesn't play well with App Domains, and so doesn't work easily using
Excel-DNA, for example. It had been suggested that RedGate.AppHost could be used
to deal with the problem, and so this example project was made. It works!

## Build

This solution was built using Visual Studio Community 2015.

Usual procedure to launch an Excel add-in:

  1. Open the Properties window for the ExcelDnaExample project.
  2. Set the 'Start external program' option to 'EXCEL.EXE' in path for your Office install.
  3. Set the 'Command line arguments' option to 'ExcelDnaExample.xll'

Now when you Start the solution it will launch Excel and the add-in.
